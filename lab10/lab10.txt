10.1
a)NoSQL is more flexible in how the data is structured. SQL databases use SQL.
b)It would reduce the latency to retrieve comments.
It would be more secure since the request and response would stay local.
If you were storing a lot of data the price comparison between cloud services
 and local storage may change.
c) limited storage and bandwith, no backups
10.2
a)npm start, because the only modifications are being made to the server.js
not the app code.
b)
It is reflected in the SPA much like when I edited the comments.json file.
c)
noSQL is probably the best since the comments are a collection of json objects.
SQL could probably be made to work though.
