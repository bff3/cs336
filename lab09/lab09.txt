a) 243B. It puts the libraries used into one file to control the
version
b) precompiles more modern JS into older, more compatible JS
c) No, because the express server is serving up the comments
d)searches for files with .jsx? in them to run through the compiler

9.2
a)
index.html now has a script tag where the template does not. bundle.js
now has a bunch of __webpack_require__() statements with my modules in them.
bundle.js is now 1.26MB
b)
Control the version of libraries you use.
Don't rely on third party to serve your libraries.
c)
just bundle.js and index.html are being served

9.3
There is an info and websocket request not on the 3000 server.
the webpack dev server auto-reloads when a change is made to the scripts.
api/comments return a json formatted list of comments.
the SPA on port 3000 does not automatically change when the modules are edited,
only the comments.json.
b)
I'd say so, save a little time building the bundle and reloading the page.
