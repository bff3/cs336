a)
  i) The UI uses props to inherit properties from a parent ui element to the
  children elements.
  ii) JSX is a preprocessor lets you write in XML syntax to generate JavaScript
  iii)
  ReactJs automatically escapes strings so you can't inject markup
  iv)
  The data is passed with this.state.data
  The data is loaded into the state through an ajax request every 2 seconds
  v)
  props are immutable. State is mutable. For example, when a comment is created,
  the Author and message are immutable props, the comment list is recreated with
  an immutable props, and the comments are passed into the state to be sent to
  the loadCommentsFromServer
b)
  i) it's reflected on the web app, because the ajax is updating the CommentList
  every 2 seconds.
  ii) because it passes them into comment list which usses the commetn class to
  render each comment.
  iii) You don't have the case where the components represent an invalid or
  inaccurate state.
  iv) it doesn't handle if the comment is rejected, so doesn't remove the comment
  if it's rejected.
